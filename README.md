# End-to-End MLOps Project with GCP

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for food data analysis and prediction.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a complete MLOps workflow on GCP, focusing on food-related data. The project showcases best practices for building, training, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models in a cloud environment, culminating in a machine learning web application hosted on appspot.com.

## Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Model deployment on GCP AI Platform
- Web application deployment on App Engine
- Monitoring and logging
